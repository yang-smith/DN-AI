UNTYPED_ENTITY_RELATIONSHIPS_GENERATION_PROMPT = """
-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, first identify all entities needed from the text in order to capture the information and ideas in the text.
Next, report all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{{tuple_delimiter}}<entity_name>{{tuple_delimiter}}<entity_type>{{tuple_delimiter}}<entity_description>

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
 Format each relationship as ("relationship"{{tuple_delimiter}}<source_entity>{{tuple_delimiter}}<target_entity>{{tuple_delimiter}}<relationship_description>{{tuple_delimiter}}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in 中文 as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{{record_delimiter}}** as the list delimiter. If you have to translate, just translate the descriptions, nothing else!

4. When finished, output {{completion_delimiter}}

Arm's (ARM) stock skyrocketed in its opening day on the Nasdaq Thursday. But IPO experts warn that the British chipmaker's debut on the public markets isn't indicative of how other newly listed companies may perform.

COMMUNITY_REPORT_PROMPT = """You are an AI assistant that helps a human analyst to perform general information discovery. 
Information discovery is the process of identifying and assessing relevant information associated with certain entities (e.g., organizations and individuals) within a network.

# Goal
Write a comprehensive report of a community, given a list of entities that belong to the community as well as their relationships and optional associated claims. The report will be used to inform decision-makers about information associated with the community and their potential impact. The content of this report includes an overview of the community's key entities, their legal compliance, technical capabilities, reputation, and noteworthy claims.

# Report Structure

The report should include the following sections:

- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific. When possible, include representative named entities in the title.
- SUMMARY: An executive summary of the community's overall structure, how its entities are related to each other, and significant information associated with its entities.
- IMPACT SEVERITY RATING: a float score between 0-10 that represents the severity of IMPACT posed by entities within the community.  IMPACT is the scored importance of a community.
- RATING EXPLANATION: Give a single sentence explanation of the IMPACT severity rating.
- DETAILED FINDINGS: A list of 5-10 key insights about the community. Each insight should have a short summary followed by multiple paragraphs of explanatory text grounded according to the grounding rules below. Be comprehensive.

Return output as a well-formed JSON-formatted string with the following format:
    {{

# Grounding Rules

Points supported by data should list their data references as follows:

"This is an example sentence supported by multiple data references [Data: <dataset name> (record ids); <dataset name> (record ids)]."

Do not list more than 5 record ids in a single reference. Instead, list the top 5 most relevant record ids and add "+more" to indicate that there are more.

For example:
"Person X is the owner of Company Y and subject to many allegations of wrongdoing [Data: Reports (1), Entities (5, 7); Relationships (23); Claims (7, 2, 34, 64, 46, +more)]."

where 1, 5, 7, 23, 2, 34, 46, and 64 represent the id (not the index) of the relevant data record.

Do not include information where the supporting evidence for it is not provided.
